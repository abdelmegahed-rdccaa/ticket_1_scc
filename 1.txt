Dear Support,

We’re starting to use GCP’s SCC (Security Command Center) & I found out that there is (potentially) a documentation bug regarding the latency of monitoring_findings [1] (fyi, monitoring_findings are scanned and reported by Security Health Analytics).

As documented here [2], “most detections run in real time against asset configuration changes (exceptions are detailed in Security Health Analytics Detection Latency [3]).”

Test:
I created a log-based metric and an alerting policy (see attachment*) in a test project.
I triggered the ‘CUSTOM_ROLE_NOT_MONITORED’ findings [1] by creating a custom role in the same test project.
Expected behaviour:
State of ‘CUSTOM_ROLE_NOT_MONITORED’ finding (in SCC) to change to INACTIVE in real-time; since it's not in the list of exceptions [3].
Actual behaviour:
The ‘CUSTOM_ROLE_NOT_MONITORED’ finding was NOT fired at realtime and was fired at 8AM EST.
After doing some more tests, I’m able to confirm that the ‘CUSTOM_ROLE_NOT_MONITORED’ finding is scanned/reported every 12 hours (once @ 8AM EST & the other @ 8PM EST) and is NOT scanned in real-time.
Ask:
Can you confirm if monitoring_findings [1] scans are supposed to execute in realtime or in 12-hours intervals. If the latter is true, can you file for a documentation bug to add monitoring-findings to the list of exceptions [2].

Thanks,
AM
